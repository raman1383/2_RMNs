// tradeoffs in software happen when you want two big features from one system

// our goal was to reduce the WTF/sec

// design so it is possible to initialize var same time in same line is used

// a new category of syntaxes are added to make RMN close to Pseudo code:
    swap [x] with [y]
    length of [x]
    range of [x..y]
    addr of [ptr name]
    deref [ptr name]
