// tradeoffs in software happen when you want two big features from one system

// our goal was to reduce the WTF/sec

// add a DS&Algs part to stdLib, containing all common DSs & algorithms

// design so it is possible to initialize var same time in same line is used

// a new category of syntaxes are added to make RMN close to Pseudo code:
    swap [x] with [y]
    length of [x]
    range of [x to y]
    addr of [ptrName]
    deref [ptrName]
